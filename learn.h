/*GET TRAINING DATA FILE

  1st line has int K = # of attributes
  2nd line has int N = # of training exampels in the training data set
  Nth lines has the N training examples.(list of comma seperated double precision floating point values.)
  - the first K double precision values represent the values for the attributes of the house
  - the last double precision value in the line represents the price of the house1

  to do:
       - read 1st line line to know the number of attributes to be stored in the Nth lines as attributes
       - last line will be stored as the price
       - read 2nd line to know how many training examples there are going to be to loop that many times through the file
